# TODO for E-Wallet App Implementation

## Phase 1: Login and Register Forms
- [x] Implement AuthContext.tsx: Create authentication context with login, signup, logout functions using localStorage.
- [x] Implement Login.tsx: Build login form with email and password fields, handle submission and redirect.
- [x] Implement Signup.tsx: Build signup form with email, password, confirm password fields, handle submission and redirect.
- [x] Update App.tsx: Ensure routing for /login, /signup, /dashboard with protected routes.
- [x] Create package.json and install dependencies.
- [ ] Test the forms: Run the app, test login/signup flows using browser_action (disabled, so manual test).

## Future Phases
- Implement dashboard and card management features.
- Add OCR, encryption, etc.
